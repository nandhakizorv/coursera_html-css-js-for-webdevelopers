                    Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 â€“ 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists
                    of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution.He stated 3 important laws of motion, which was a breakthrough for many technologies in the world.

                    Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. In the following decade, he immigrated to the
                    U.S. after being targeted by the German Nazi Party.His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most
                    influential physicist of the 20th century.

                    Italian inventor and engineer Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937) developed, demonstrated and marketed the first successful long-distance wireless telegraph and in 1901 broadcast the first transatlantic radio signal. ... In 1909 he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics
                    for his radio work.The Nobel Prize in Physics 1909 was awarded jointly to Guglielmo Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun "in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy."He also invented magnetic detector and mononpole antenna.
