      <p class="item-name">Chicken Sandwich</p>
      <p>The sandwich usually consists of a chicken filet or patty, toppings and bread. The chicken meat can be deep fried, grilled, roasted or boiled, served hot or cold, and white or dark meat chicken can be used. Shredded chicken in one form or another, such as chicken salad, can also be used in chicken sandwiches. Another form is made with cold cuts. Wrap versions of the sandwich can also be made, in which the ingredients are rolled up inside a flatbread, such as a tortilla. Open-faced versions of the sandwich, which feature hot chicken served with gravy on top of bread, are also common variations.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Shawarma</p>
      <p>Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 60 cm (20 in) high. Lamb fat may be added to provide extra fat for juiciness and flavor. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of a heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, sharp knife.Spices may include cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric and paprika, and in some areas baharat.[13][3] Shawarma is commonly served as a sandwich or wrap, in a flatbread such as pita or laffa.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
